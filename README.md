# FAQ
Q: Why?<br>
A: Because I am removing these components from the API

Q: How do I run it?<br>
A: You use quart (Flask, but with async) and blueprints. I won't copy-paste the entire API for people to instantly steal it, if that's what you thought you could do.

Q: Can I use it for my API?<br>
A: Yes, but give credits in some way
